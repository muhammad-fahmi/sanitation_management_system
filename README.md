# Bionic Cleaning Tracker - Sanitation Management System

The **Bionic Cleaning Tracker** is a comprehensive Sanitation Management System backend built to track, manage, and verify cleaning tasks across various locations. It provides a robust REST API and a management interface powered by **CodeIgniter 4**, **PHP 8.3**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Features & Roles

The system employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with three primary roles:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Access the analytics dashboard. Manage users, locations, items, and cleaning actions. |
| **Operator** | Perform cleaning tasks, scan locations, submit task completions, and handle revisions. |
| **Verifikator** | Review and verify submitted tasks. Export data and generate summary reports. |

### Key Capabilities
- **Task Tracking:** Operators can log tasks and log visits (e.g. by scanning locations).
- **Verification Workflow:** Verifikators can review submissions and manage verification statuses.
- **Reporting:** Export filtered task logs and generate recapitulation reports to Excel (via PhpSpreadsheet).
- **Profile Management:** Users can manage their personal information, update passwords, and upload profile photos.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** CodeIgniter 4
- **Language:** PHP 8.3+
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Session & JWT (`firebase/php-jwt`)
- **Reporting:** PhpSpreadsheet
